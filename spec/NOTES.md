# Idea for Best Episodes for Super Fans & Quarantine Binge Watchers (of The Office?)

This CLI will provide the user with a list of shows (3).  From there, the user will be able to select a show from the list. Once they have selected their show, the user will be able to select an episode. This gem will have a CLI that shows the user a description of the episode they clicked along with a link giving more information (where they can watch, cast info, etc).

# The Behavior 

1. Greet the user 
2. Display the list of shows 
3. Ask for the user input 
4. Show the list of episodes for inputted show (SECOND LEVEL OF DATA)
5. Ask for user input (to select the episode of choice)
6. Based on user input, display description and url for more info (THIRD LEVEL OF DATA)
7. Ask for user input to return back to menu or list of episodes
