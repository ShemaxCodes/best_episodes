# Idea for Best Episodes 

This CLI will provide the user with a list of shows (3).  From there, the user will be able to select a show from the list. Once they have selected their show, the user will be able to select an episode. This gem will have a CLI that shows the user a description of the episode they clicked along with a link giving more information (where they can watch, cast info, etc).
